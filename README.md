# Voting-System

The Voting System is a simple and basic python project that conducts an election between two nominees. The program asks for the names of the nominees and creates a list of voters. It then allows voters to cast their votes by selecting their preferred nominee. Once all the voters have voted, the program checks which nominee has the most votes and declares them the winner.
